# ShapesProject
 
Your job is to create a Main class that can test out the Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle class

## **Main Class**
Give the user a menu
- create shape
		- Rectangle
		- Circle
		- Triangle
- change properties
		- side length
		- radius
- view properties
		- side length (rectangle/triangle)
		- radius (circle)
		- area
		- perimeter/circumference
- quit

Because we have not learned Arrays yet, it won't be possible for you to keep track of multiple shapes.
Simply keep one of each shape that can be accessed, created, or modified

##**Rectangle Class**
Must have:
- length
- width
- area (not set by user)
- perimeter (not set by user)

*Methods*
- Constructor (default to side length 1)
- Constructor (one side)
- Constructor (two sides)
- Getters/Setters
- FindPerimeter (private!)
- FindArea (private!)
- PrintStats

##**Triangle Class**
Assume right angle triangle! Side A is height. Side B is base
Must have: 
- Side A
- Side B
- Side C
- Perimeter (not set by user)
- Area (not set by user)

*Methods*
- Constructor (default to side length 1)
- Constructor (A, B, C)
- Getters/Setters
- FindPerimeter (private!)
- FindArea (private!)
- PrintStats

##**Circle Class**
Must have:
- Radius
- Circumference (not set by user)
- Area (not set by user)

*Methods*
- Constructor (default to radius 1)
- Constructor (r)
- Getters/Setters
- FindCircumference (private!)
- FindArea (private!)
- PrintStats
